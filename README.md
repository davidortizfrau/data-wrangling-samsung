Library Dependencies

dplyr - https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/README.html
tidyr - https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/README.html

Requirements:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2. Extracts columns containing mean and standard deviation for each measurement (Hint: Since some feature/column names are repeated, you may need to use the make.names() function in R)

3. Creates variables called ActivityLabel and ActivityName that label all observations with the corresponding activity labels and names respectively

4. From the data set in step 3, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

==================================================================

Consult CodeBook.md for explanation of variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data.
